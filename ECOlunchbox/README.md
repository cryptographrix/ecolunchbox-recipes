## ECOlunchbox-recipes/ECOlunchbox
----------------------------------
This is the main repo for all combination of [ECOlunchboxes](http://ecolunchboxes.com/).

ECOlunchboxes should be included under this by description (i.e. - [ECOlunchbox "Three-in-One"](http://ecolunchboxes.com/ecolunchbox-three-in-one/) should go under Three-in-One)

### Considerations

####ECOlunchboxes are not leak-proof. 
They recommend storing damp, not wet foods in them, as there are no gaskets added to create a seal.  To get around this, I use small reusable plastic bottles of vinegar, soy sauce, and other liquids to add at lunchtime.

I also will sometimes put wet food in the "small section"/"snack container" of the "Three-in-One" using some form of tape as a seal around the outside.
