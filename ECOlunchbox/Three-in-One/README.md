### ECOlunchbox-recipes/ECOlunchbox/Three-in-One
------------------------------------------------
This is the repository for all combinations of food possible for the [ECOlunchbox "Three-in-One"](http://ecolunchboxes.com/ecolunchbox-three-in-one/).

#### Sections
There are three sections in this lunchbox.  They are described as:

* big (upper or lower containers containing only food)
* medium (upper container with one side containing the ""snack container"")
* small (the "snack container")

#### Combinations
The lunch box can be used as 1 each of big, medium, and small sections, or as 2 big, and 1 small section (by carrying the small container independent of the lunchbox).

Only the upper big section can contain the small/"snack container" as it is deeper than the bottom section - 1.0" for the bottom section vs. 1.5" for the top section.
