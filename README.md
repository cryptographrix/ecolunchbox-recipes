# ECOlunchbox-recipes
---------------------

## Summary

This is a collection of recipes to fit the [ECOlunchbox "Three-in-One"](http://ecolunchboxes.com/ecolunchbox-three-in-one/).

It could eventually support other sectioned lunchboxes, but this currently exists just to organize my own thoughts - feel free to submit a pull request.

## The concept of a modular meal

Central to these recipes are the concept of a "modular meal."  This is something that a lot of articles talk about [[1](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/modular-meals/)] [[2](http://www.nutritionbydrdeyo.com/modular-meals-in-minutes)] [[3](http://ask.metafilter.com/205268/What-can-I-add-to-my-Modular-Meal-System)], so that's the terminology I've chosen to describe it.

I feel that it describes meals for the ECOlunchbox "Three-in-One" well.
